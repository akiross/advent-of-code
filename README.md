# advent-of-code
I enjoy doing puzzles, but they have a lower priority than other projects, so I never finish them.

This repo has my solutions, for a subset of the problems.

It is empty because the empty set is a valid subset. Also, because the code is on [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/akiross/advent-of-code).
